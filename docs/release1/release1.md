# Release 1

App name: **"Personal Finance"**

The goal with this project is to create an app which serves as a complete and organized overview of the user's own financial situation.

**Implemented functionality for release 1:**
 * New user creation
 * Log in
 * Simple overview of user's transactions
 * Ability to log/create new transactions
 * Release 1 contains two tests for user creation.

**The Work Process**
 * At out first group meeting we decided what our project was going to be by first brainstorming ideas, and then deciding on one.
 * Then we created user stories for the application, and picked out a few which would be important for getting started on the project and which would cover the demands for Delivarable 1.
 * We had a Sprint Planning Meeting, where we distributed the user stories among us. 
 * During the span of one week, each worked on their user story(ies). 
 * After one week we had our first weekly meeting, where everyone presented their work so far and discussed challenges that had come up. At this meeting it was decided that the app would simply be called "Personal Finance". 
 * We figured out what needed to be done before the deadline, and distributed the remaining work.
 * Project was ready for Release 1 on 22.09.2022.
